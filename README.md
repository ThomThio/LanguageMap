# LanguageMap
Learning a language by their character relationships between new words learnt, and comes along with a flashcard-style tester

Ever tried learning a new language, but face the hassle of memorizing how each word is related to something else?
Ever wanted to be able to test yourself quickly, without preparing your notes or flashcards?

Well, this is what LanguageMap tries to achieve.

Using a network graph, we plot the relationships between Chinese characters used in words/phrases/idioms - this has (personally) helped in finding relationships between the characters, and thus aiding in memory.
In addition, turning on a "Test Mode" enables flashcarding - you can hover over a word to see its pronunciation and translation to reveal it - unless you remember them first :)
